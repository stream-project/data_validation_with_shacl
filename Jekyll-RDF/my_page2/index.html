<h1>Data quality reports of material data</h1>
This is the site in which data quality reports of specific datasets from NOMAD or DSMS are shown.
These reports are generated by RDFUnit, a tool which does apply SHACL shapes on the RDF dataset representation.
The reports are technical. For general reports please have a look at <span class="badge badge-secondary">Not yet existing</span>.
