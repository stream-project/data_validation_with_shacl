# data_validation_with_shacl
Repository which has all the services in it to do the data validation based on the maturity model using SHACL.


## Idea
Users on the LDM could start data quality tests and see test results. For this a CKAN extension is needed which calls the RDFUnit service and forwards users to the corresponding Jekyll page of the given dataset.

## RDFUnit
This is a webhook which puts ids send via http into a fifo queue of which each entry (id) is then used to gather SHACL shapes and RDF data from a SPARQL endpoint to generate reports.
These reports are stored in a ttl file.

## Jekyll-RDF
This is a Jekyll container with the Jekyll-RDF plugin installed. It uses the ttl file generated by RDFUnit service to show RDFUnit reports as HTML websites.

## TODO

* authentification when using SPARQL endpoint
* using graph URIs based on dataset metadata
